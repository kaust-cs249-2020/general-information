# Algorithms in Bioinformatics

## Timing
The schedule has been changed and the first class will take place
on Monday, 31 August, 16:45-18:15.

The regular time of the class is not yet fixed and we will decide the
times in the first class on Monday. Because we have students from all
over the world and in different time zones, we plan to have one class
in the morning and the other class in the evening (KAUST time), so
that all students have the opportunity to participate at a reasonable
time.

## Join online
This class will start as an online-only class held through Zoom. Any changes will be communicated here and on Mattermost.

## Online resources
We will use an interactive teaching platform for this course,
Stepik, and an interactive version of the "Bioinformatics Algorithms"
textbook. To participate in this course, you need to register at
https://stepik.org/course/73755/ (Algorithms in Bioinformatics @ KAUST). The interactive textbook (which you will keep after the
course) costs 69.95 USD, please register at Stepik and purchase this
textbook. If you are a "regular" student of CS249, you will be
reimbursed for the cost of the textbook by KAUST. To process the
reimbursement, please contact Wadha Aljishi; if
you are unable to purchase the textbook yourself for any reason,
please also contact Wadha as soon as possible who will be able to
assist you. If you are an auditing student of this class, you need to
purchase your own textbook and will not be reimbursed. If you decide
to drop the class within the next 2 weeks, you can return the textbook
for a full refund.
